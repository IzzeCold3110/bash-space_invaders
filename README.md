# [unix/bash] Space Invaders

While I was waiting for a long-running job to finish 
I was curious and sure that there is a
playable version of Space Invaders for Bash-Console.
It first felt like the controls are two far away 
from eath other so I decided to switch them to a more 
comfortable new assigns.

## Controls
A - Move Left
D - Move Right
F - Fire
